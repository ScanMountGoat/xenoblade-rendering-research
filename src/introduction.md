# Introduction
This site covers rendering related topics for the Xenoblade Chronicles Switch games.
This includes Xenoblade Chronicles 1 Definitive Edition, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3. 

The various pages provide a high level overview of important rendering techniques found in game. The goal is to provide enough information to suitably approximate these techniques in other applications and make informed decisions for modding. Some pages may briefly mention implementation details if they have important implications for what effects are possible with modding. No graphics programming experience is necessary, but some familiarity with graphics terminology like "texture" or "shader" is assumed. For specific implementation details reverse engineered from in game, see the source code for [xc3_wgpu](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib/tree/main/xc3_wgpu).
