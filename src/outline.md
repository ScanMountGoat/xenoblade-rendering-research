# Outlines
Outline rendering adds a stylized border around character models in game. The effect can be subtle in game due to a low outline thickness and may only be visible in some games while zoomed in. Outlines in game are achieved by culling the back faces of the normal mesh and the front faces of the outline mesh. The outline mesh is scaled along the normal or "inflated" to adjust the outline thickness. This "inverted hull" technique is common in many games since it is simple to implement and relatively cheap to render. The game uses a number of parameters to control the color and thickness of the outlines.
