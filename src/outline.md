# Outlines
Outline rendering adds a stylized border around character models in game. The effect can be subtle in game due to small outline thickness and only be visible in some games while zoomed in. Outlines in game are achieved using duplicate meshes with opposite back face culling settings to draw the outlines. The outline mesh is scaled along the normal or "inflated" to adjust the thickness. This "inverted hull" technique is common in many games since it is simple to implement and relatively cheap to render. The game uses a number of parameters to control the color and thickness of the outlines.
